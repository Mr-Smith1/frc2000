The **LIC Robodogs** are a New York City based FIRST Robotics Competition team.

## History

Throughout their over 11 years of existence, they've perservered despite socioeconomic difficulties among their members. In doing so, they've given back to the community by participating in outreach events in local Boys and Girls clubs and elementary schools, as well as larger events such as Maker Faire and the Intrepid museum. The **LIC Robodogs** are a shining example of students being able to succeed if given the proper environment to grow and hone their skills.
